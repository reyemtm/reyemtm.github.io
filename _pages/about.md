### Malcolm Meyer

I have a passion for web-based data visualization and analysis. Formally, I am a graduate of the Ohio University International Studies Program, with a BA in Sociology and Urban Planning from The College of Wooster. I also love [music](http://malcolmmeyer.tumblr.com) and gardening. I spend my days building maps for the City of Zanesville. Formerly I analyzed transportation data for the [Ohio Valley Regional Development Commission](http://www.ovrdc.org). You can see the OVRDC map gallery built with Jekyll, Bootstrap 4 and JQuery [here](http://www.ovrdc.org/gis/maps).
