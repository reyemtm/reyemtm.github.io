My name is Malcolm Meyer and I have a passion for web-based data visualization and analysis. Formally, I am a graduate of the Ohio University International Studies Program, with a BA in Sociology and Urban Planning from The College of Wooster. I also love [music](http://malcolmmeyer.tumblr.com) and gardening. I spend my days building cool maps and apps for the [City of Zanesville](https://gis.coz.org). My previous GIS experience includes analyzing transportation data for the [Ohio Valley Regional Development Commission](http://www.ovrdc.org/maps), digitizing utility data for the City of Columbus, and working with a multi-national team on the [Multinational Geospatial Data Co-Production Program](https://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/spring11articles/multinational-mapmaking-in-the-czech-republic.html) for the now defunct TechniGraphics.
