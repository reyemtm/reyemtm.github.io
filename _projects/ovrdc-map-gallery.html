about: >-
  I built this for both internal and external use showing all public (and development) OVRDC web maps. The page is built with Bootstrap v4, jQuery and Jekyll. A loop is used on the maps to place the ``page.tag`` into the class, allowing for the jQuery filter at the top of the page. The full page app is then inserted into our Wordpress site with an iframe.
