about: >-
  Aside from GIS and data analysis, I occasionally build and design websites. I have utilized a variety of frameworks and platforms incuding Bootstrap, Bulma and Pavilion frameworks, and CMS tools including Jekyll, Squarespace and Wordpress. These sites range from slight variations on built-in tempates to complete custom websites, such as this blog. The AOGDP website was a joint effort with the AOGDP Leadership team.
