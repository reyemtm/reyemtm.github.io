about: >-
  A responsive store locator based on the [Mapbox JS](https://www.mapbox.com/help/building-a-store-locator/) example, tweaked to use Leaflet 1.0 and custom icons. The sidebar uses a simple jQuery filter function (thanks jsfiddle). The nearest store function uses TurfJS, based loosely on [this example](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/coffee-with-turf/), also from Mapbox. The production version uses [surge.sh](https://surge.sh) for deployment. This app was created in collaboration with Nick Kroncke and [Shagbark](https://shagbarkmill.com/).
